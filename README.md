## Project Proposal

Our project is to uncover patterns in crude oil prices and oil company stock prices. We'll examine relationships between different oil companies, short-term relationships in prices of comodity and stock, long-term relationships in prices of comodity and stock trends over the course of the many years, and related questions as the data permits.

## Questions 

1. To what extent is oil price a proxy for the stock price for an oil company?

2. To what extent are spikes in volume exchanges indicative of stock price change?

3. Can a ratio of stock price to oil price provide valuable insight? Perhaps opportunities to buy/sell?

4. 5. Is there a max  price you would buy *insert stock__ that would seem to ensure long term (5-10 year) gains?

6. How does oil price compare with gold? How does oil do relative to inflation indicators? 

7. How does oil price or a typical stock ticker compare with the S&P 500? Are there seasonal effects to consider?

8. What world events shaped these graphs? Is investing in oil just waiting around for global crises?
