## Project Proposal

Our project is to uncover patterns in crude oil prices and oil company stock prices. We'll examine relationships between different oil companies, short-term relationships in prices of comodity and stock, long-term relationships in prices of comodity and stock trends over the course of the many years, and related questions as the data permits.

## Questions 

1. To what extent is oil price a proxy for the stock price for an oil company?

2. What connection is there between the volumes activity and stock price?

3. Can a ratio of stock price to oil price provide valuable insight? Perhaps opportunities to buy/sell?

4. How does oil price compare with gold? How does oil do relative to inflation indicators? 

5. How does oil price or a typical stock ticker compare with the S&P 500?
